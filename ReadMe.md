- This is a basic **React** todo app.
- Initial commit will be done using vanilla html.

> Later, planning to add **Material UI** components.

- Existing Features :-
	- Add a todo.
	- Look at the existing Todos.
	- Mark a todo as - Done.

#### Features TO-DO :-
- User Signin, Signup.
- Add a Deadline.
- After clicking on 'Mark as completed' , move the todo to another Array --- Todo Completed.
  	- These 2 can be arranged as a carousal maybe..? Or the Completed array can be
  	  added as a dropdown...
